And he hasn't hidden anything when it comes to his role as <a href=#>James Bond</a>.</p><p>"I'd rather break this glass and slash my wrists [than do another James Bond movie]," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Time Out</a> in 2015, before resuming the role in 2021's smash hit <a href=#>No Time to Die</a>.</p><p>Daniel was open about the complications he had to face since first accepting the role in October 2005. Now we know that No Time to Die is his final James Bond movie. The search for the next star has seen a few different names thrown around, but no one has been confirmed to take over the role so far.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: MGM/Universal Pictures</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who will be the next James Bond? Here are the most popular bets.</h2><p>Daniel first announced that he was ready to hang up his hat and pass on the baton (and the shaken, not stirred vodka martini that comes with it) circa 2015, after sustaining an injury on the set of Spectre.</p><p>In recent years, the creators have had plenty of time to spitball ideas and work out which rising star will make for Daniel's perfect replacement. In September 2022, the producers told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> they are in the early stages of casting an actor willing to make a 10-12 year commitment to the role.</p><p>Fans have also been incredibly vocal about their perfect replacements and are sharing their theories on social media. So, who is the likeliest to become the next <a href=#>James Bond</a>? Let's find out!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Will Idris Elba land James Bond's role? There has been a lot of chatter about him.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Born in London in 1972, Idris has amassed an armada of fans with appearances in hit shows like Luther and <a href=#>The Wire</a>. Let's be honest — his voice alone could make him the perfect 007.</p><p>Speaking to Capital XTRA (per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NME</a>) in April 2021, Idris said, “I know the rumors about Bond have always chased me. Listen, my poor mum is like, ‘One day you’re going to get it!’ I was like ‘Mum, I’m good, I’ve got Luther!’ I’m definitely doing that.”</p><p>When you look at all of the stars that have been name-dropped as potential replacements for Daniel, Idris tends to come up most frequently; however, it's unlikely the 50-year-old star will step into the role. In August 2022, Idris spoke with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wall Street Journal</a> and revealed he is no longer up for the challenge since he doesn't see Bond when he "looks in the mirror."</p><p>On Sept. 21, the James Bond producers told Variety that they "understand" Idris's decision.</p><p>"The thing is, it’s going to be a couple of years off," Barbara Broccoli noted. "And when we cast Bond, it’s a 10, 12-year commitment. So he’s probably thinking, 'Do I really want that thing?' Not everybody wants to do that. It was hard enough getting [Daniel Craig to do it]." Michael G. Wilson quickly interjected, "And he was in his early 30s at the time!"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Richard Madden has fans' support for becoming the next James Bond.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Star of popular series Bodyguard and <a href=#>Game of Thrones</a>, Richard Madden has been asked about being the next James Bond for some time. He's said he's happy even being considered for the role, but it seems like he doubts he'll get it.</p><p>"It’s very flattering to be involved in that conversation at all, but it’s all just talk, and I’m sure next week it’ll be someone different,” Richard said at a press conference for <a href=#>Rocketman</a> back in 2019.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Regé-Jean Page slickly dismissed the James Bond–related rumors in an interview with Jimmy Fallon.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The Zimbabwe-born actor skyrocketed to fame with <a href=#>Bridgerton</a>. He quit the <a href=#>Netflix</a> series in the spring of 2021, leaving him with plenty of time to focus on other creative endeavors.</p><p>But he dismissed the Bond rumors in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jimmy Fallon</a> in January 2021. And in September 2021, he did the same with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>, telling the mag, “Well, of all the things you’ll read about yourself on the internet, it’s one of the more pleasant and more flattering. But I take it and leave it at that, personally.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Could Tom Hardy be the next James Bond?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The London-born actor has been a longtime favorite among fans of the James Bond franchise, and it's easy to see why. His towering physique, charismatic personality, and exceptional ability to nail characters like Alfie Solomons in the Peaky Blinders make him the perfect candidate for the job.</p><p>In a 2021 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>, Tom even deployed the rhetoric strategy that signals best that someone is about to become the next James Bond. He firmly refused to discuss his appointment as James Bond.</p><p>"There's a saying amongst us in the fraternity of acting ... that if you talk about it [Bond rumors], you're automatically out of the race," Tom told GQ. "So I can't possibly comment on that one!"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Tom Holland may also be in the running for James Bond's role.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>A successful actor and producer, Tom has already appeared in franchise movies like the latest <a href=#>Spider-Man</a> films. Some James Bond purists believe that the role tends to go to an actor who is yet to land a career-defining role — which slightly decreases Tom's chances.</p><p>In March 2021, Tom told U.K. radio show Heart (per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>) that if asked to play Bond, it would be a "dream come true," adding, "Should they want to do a younger James Bond, you best believe I would be there."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How about Henry Cavill?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Renowned for his impeccable physique and impressive acting chops, <a href=#>Henry Cavill</a> could easily be described as the next James Bond in the making. Henry has already appeared in hit shows like The Tudors and <a href=#>The Witcher</a>. But who is going to hold his career achievements against him?</p><p>And back when he was around 21, Henry apparently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">did a screen-test</a> for Bond.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Some fans believe that Cillian Murphy is going to be the next James Bond.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Famed for his ice-cold precision and incredible versatility, Cillian has easily shouldered roles like Thomas Shelby in <a href=#>Peaky Blinders</a> and Jim in 28 Days Later. Is he about to add James Bond's role to his already impressive portfolio?</p><p>After all, Peaky Blinders has <a href=#>come to an end</a>, which leaves him with plenty of time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwedaio6Vlkpp6tbTEZqWesKRit6K5xKxkm6eemQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-will-be-the-next-james-bond.html&text=Who%20Will%20Be%20the%20Next%20James%20Bond%3f%20The%20Search%20Has%20Begun&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-will-be-the-next-james-bond.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-will-be-the-next-james-bond.html&title=Who%20Will%20Be%20the%20Next%20James%20Bond%3f%20The%20Search%20Has%20Begun" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-will-be-the-next-james-bond.html&title=Who%20Will%20Be%20the%20Next%20James%20Bond%3f%20The%20Search%20Has%20Begun" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-will-be-the-next-james-bond.html&title=Who%20Will%20Be%20the%20Next%20James%20Bond%3f%20The%20Search%20Has%20Begun" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-will-be-the-next-james-bond.html&description=Who%20Will%20Be%20the%20Next%20James%20Bond%3f%20The%20Search%20Has%20Begun" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./aurelia-vozella-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aurelia Taylor - Age, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./morgan-wallen-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Morgan Wallen's Net Worth: How Recent Controversy Has Put His Career in Danger">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
