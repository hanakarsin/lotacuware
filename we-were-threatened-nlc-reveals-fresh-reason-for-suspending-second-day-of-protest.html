That was also one of the reasons we had to restructure on the second day of the nationwide protest,” he added.</p><p>“You may have noticed that almost all the routes to our office have been militarised this morning. It took a lot of time to access our office. These are not things you expect from a democratic society.</p><p>“We want to reiterate that if the government fails to comply within the specified time frame, the NEC will convene again to decide on the next line of action.</p><p>“The NLC remains steadfast in its commitment to defending and promoting the interests of Nigerian workers and the downtrodden masses, who will not succumb to intimidation,” he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FxZrCdXayys7GMrZ%2BrnZGpsq%2Bxw2alpZtdp7K3scClqmaeoprAqXnRnpisp55is7C%2BjKysrKiVo7GqusZmqp6bn6OxbrDAsmSonl2lv7DAxKyraA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwe-were-threatened-nlc-reveals-fresh-reason-for-suspending-second-day-of-protest.html&text=%27We%20Were%20Threatened%27%20-%20NLC%20Reveals%20Fresh%20Reason%20For%20Suspending%20Second%20Day%20Of%20Protest&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwe-were-threatened-nlc-reveals-fresh-reason-for-suspending-second-day-of-protest.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwe-were-threatened-nlc-reveals-fresh-reason-for-suspending-second-day-of-protest.html&title=%27We%20Were%20Threatened%27%20-%20NLC%20Reveals%20Fresh%20Reason%20For%20Suspending%20Second%20Day%20Of%20Protest" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwe-were-threatened-nlc-reveals-fresh-reason-for-suspending-second-day-of-protest.html&title=%27We%20Were%20Threatened%27%20-%20NLC%20Reveals%20Fresh%20Reason%20For%20Suspending%20Second%20Day%20Of%20Protest" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwe-were-threatened-nlc-reveals-fresh-reason-for-suspending-second-day-of-protest.html&title=%27We%20Were%20Threatened%27%20-%20NLC%20Reveals%20Fresh%20Reason%20For%20Suspending%20Second%20Day%20Of%20Protest" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwe-were-threatened-nlc-reveals-fresh-reason-for-suspending-second-day-of-protest.html&description=%27We%20Were%20Threatened%27%20-%20NLC%20Reveals%20Fresh%20Reason%20For%20Suspending%20Second%20Day%20Of%20Protest" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kirk-brandon-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kirk Brandon - Age, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-does-het-bonhe-mean-in-russian.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Does &amp;quot;Het Bonhe&amp;quot; Mean in Russian?
