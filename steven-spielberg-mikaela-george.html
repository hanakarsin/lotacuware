From Jurassic Park, to Schindler's List, Jaws, Catch Me if You Can, the Indiana Jones series, Goonies, Gremlins, Poltergeist... the list goes on and on.</p><p>Being the child of such a recognizable and successful person can make it hard to carve out a career of your own, and Steven's daughter, Mikaela George, says she's done just that.</p><p>The 23-year-old says that after years of struggling with alcoholism and depression she's found comfort and solace in pursuing adult entertainment. In an interview with The Sun, the young woman said that she's ventured into producing her own adult films. After breaking the news to her famous father and his wife, Kate Capshaw, she says that they were "not upset."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Mikaela expounded on the fulfillment she gets in being an adult performer: "I got really tired of not being able to capitalize on my body and frankly, I got really tired of being told to hate my body. And I also just got tired of working day to day in a way that wasn't satisfying to my soul. I feel like doing this kind of work, I'm able to 'satisfy' other people, but that feels good because it's not in a way that makes me feel violated."</p><p>In the same interview, Mikaela also talked about being harassed and subjected to potential abuse by "predators" when she was young and her daily struggles with borderline personality disorder.</p><p>She went public with her new job on social media, adding that she's going about producing her content in a "safe" and "consensual" way. She hopes to earn enough for herself so she can be financially independent from her father's wealth.</p><p>Mikaela, who now resides in Nashville, Tenn. said "I can't stay dependent on my parents or even the&nbsp;state for that matter –&nbsp;not that there's anything wrong with that –&nbsp;it just doesn't feel comfortable for me," and reinforces that her new career is, for her, a "positive, empowering choice."</p><p>She's applied to become a registered adult entertainment worker, and is restricting her work to solo productions only.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>It’s taken me three years to get to this point where I could start a 30 day sobriety challenge. Three years of drinking myself delirious and drunken s.h. because of a confusing breakup where I felt like my world was ending because the person I thought was the love of my life abandoned me. (Ultimately no one is responsible for my well being but me, but for an adoptee it devastated me in ways so incomprehensible to the healthy humans around me.) the heartbreak did nearly irreparable damage to my cardiac health, my boundaries and my metabolism. Somehow I managed to hide it from my family and friends until I discovered harm reduction. The thing about abstinence is, it doesn’t work for everyone and we’re sold a lie in emotional recovery that abstinence is the be all end all vs emotional health and having loving safe relationships with the people around us. That’s where harm reduction comes in. I spent a year on harm reduction and I was only ever able to start this challenge because of it. Last week I wasn’t sick, last week I actually managed to fully take care of myself for the first time in so many years. Harm reduction is about celebrating small steps that help us live our fullest life without relying on shame, unconditional positivity and religion based recovery. So with that said, now that I am going for this challenge for anyone too sick from using or withdrawal to even start thinking about short term sobriety, here are my top tips for harm reduction based recovery. If you’re not ready to stop using, you’re not ready and that doesn’t make you a bad person; it makes you a human with a deeply complex neurological system that sometimes uses old patterns to survive: 1. Never use or drink alone 2. Count your doses and count your drinks 3. Never use or drink with people you don’t trust 4. Work with your local law enforcement on addiction training and encourage a system where they aren’t incentivized for harassing addicts. 5. Know your chemical/medication interactions people 😬 6. Work with a therapist who’s willing to meet you where you are as opposed to demanding instant abstinence from substances. 💞 #harmreduction #gentlerecovery #30daysobrietychallenge</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Mikaela Spielberg</a> (@vandal_princess) on Oct 28, 2019 at 11:30am PDT</p></figure><p>She says that her fiance, 47-year-old Chuck Pankow, is supportive of her career, and thinks that she will venture off into indulging viewers' specific fetishes, hoping to become more niche as she delves further into the business.</p><p>Previously, she uploaded her videos under big sites with the name Sugar Star, but elected to take them down pending the approval of her sex worker license in Tennessee.</p><p>She hopes that her parents will be pleased to see her growth in the industry and that who she has matured to will be a positive contrast to the person she was some 18 months ago.
