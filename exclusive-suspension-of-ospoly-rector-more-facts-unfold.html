A.K. Jimoh, the state ordered Dr. Odetayo to “proceed on suspension Immediately while an investigation into the allegations leveled against” him “commences soon”.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Photo_1690312537990.jpg alt="Exclusive: Suspension Of OSPOLY Rector: More Facts Unfold " width=750 height=1000 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Appointment of an acting OSPOLY rector</h2><p>After the Osun State government suspended Dr. Odetayo as the rector of OSPOLY, the government appointed Mr. Alabi Kehinde Adeyemi as the acting rector of the polytechnic.</p><p>In an internal memo signed by Jimoh, the state ministry of education said Governor Adeleke appointed Mr. Adeyemi to take over from Dr. Odetayo “who is being investigated over the allegations of financial recklessness, corruption and misappropriation of funds and abuse of office”.</p><p>The statement added, “The erstwhile Rector should step aside pending the time the allegations against him are properly investigated by relevant bodies. The appointment of the Acting Rector takes immediate effect.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Photo_1690312458805.jpg alt="Exclusive: Suspension Of OSPOLY Rector: More Facts Unfold " width=750 height=1000 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> gathered from a reliable source that Mr. Adeyemi does not hold a Ph.D. and his highest academic qualification is an M.sc. This is said to be one of the reasons the academic staff union would find it difficult to accept him as an acting rector over other Ph.D. holders in the institution.</p><p>Also, our correspondent gathered that there was an election to elect a deputy rector of the institution some weeks ago and five lecturers participated in the process including Mr. Adeyemi. Interestingly, the new acting rector finished third at the end of the process.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Photo_1690312626862.jpg alt="Exclusive: Suspension Of OSPOLY Rector: More Facts Unfold " width=780 height=1040 sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>But to the surprise of the lecturers, when there was a need for the appointment of an acting rector, Mr. Adeyemi was deemed fit for the position ahead of others.</p><h2>The standpoint of ASUP Over OSPOLY Rector saga</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, the academic staff union of Polytechnic (ASUP), OSPOLY chapter, locked up the school entrance in protest of the suspension of Dr. Odetayo.</p><p>The ASUP members did not only lock up the school gate, they suspended academic activities indefinitely and also protested on Tuesday morning to further drive home their point that their colleague, Dr. Odetayo was suspended without due process.</p><p>ASUP chairman, OSPOLY chapter, Comrade Fatai Afolabi claimed that the state government suspended the Rector abruptly, without proper procedure.</p><p>He said, “The rector is being suspended for misappropriation, reckless and corruption, these are weighty allegations that you can’t just attach with anyone without substantive evidence, and that could be said to be a personal vendetta and absolute act of nepotism, and for this reason, there wouldn’t be examination or lectures until this is resolved.”</p><h2>The students perspective</h2><p>While the ASUP members continue to fight for the right of their colleague, Dr. Odetayo, the activities in lecture halls have been halted indefinitely due to the suspension of OSPOLY rector.</p><p>Unfortunately, this development happened when the students of the Daily Part-Time (DPT) programme were writing their examinations. Hence, the examination has to be halted indefinitely.</p><p>Also, <strong>Naija News</strong> gathered that the full-time students were supposed to undertake their second-semester examination in about two months but with the indefinite suspension of academic activities, that might be delayed a bit more.</p><p>On the side of the Students Union Government (SUG), the union is uninterested in the entire saga as it has decided to stay off of the stand-off between Dr. Odetayo and the state government.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> gathered that the SUG has dissociated itself from the protest, making it known that it is of no concern to the students as it is between the government and the institution. The union went as far as pleading with the students to vacate the ASUP’s protest ground</p><h2>OSPOLY Management Sues For Peace</h2><p>In reaction to the protest by the ASUP members, the management of OSPOLY issued a statement on Tuesday, July 25, appealing to “staffers of the Institution, especially, members of the academic staff to remain calm and orderly.”</p><p>The statement retrieved by <strong>Naija News</strong> continued: “A statement signed by the Acting Registrar of the Institution, Mr. Abiodun Oloyede stated that both the Management and State Government are working to resolve the issue concerning the suspension of the Institution’s Rector, Dr. Tajudeen Odetayo and appointment of an Acting Rector, Mr. Kehinde Alabi on Monday.</p><p>“The Acting Registrar appealed to the entire Polytechnic community to go about their normal duties as the Management is in full contact with authorities of the state government to ensure that the matter is resolved.</p><p>“He assured the students that the ongoing examination would promptly resume as soon as possible.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5FvZp6wk6HCtLXVnmSsraOlsq%2B%2FyKilZqeWYry0vM6lsGaqlZjBsL6MpqarnV2brqTA0masp56fobFw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fexclusive-suspension-of-ospoly-rector-more-facts-unfold.html&text=EXCLUSIVE%3a%20Suspension%20Of%20OSPOLY%20Rector&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fexclusive-suspension-of-ospoly-rector-more-facts-unfold.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fexclusive-suspension-of-ospoly-rector-more-facts-unfold.html&title=EXCLUSIVE%3a%20Suspension%20Of%20OSPOLY%20Rector" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fexclusive-suspension-of-ospoly-rector-more-facts-unfold.html&title=EXCLUSIVE%3a%20Suspension%20Of%20OSPOLY%20Rector" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fexclusive-suspension-of-ospoly-rector-more-facts-unfold.html&title=EXCLUSIVE%3a%20Suspension%20Of%20OSPOLY%20Rector" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fexclusive-suspension-of-ospoly-rector-more-facts-unfold.html&description=EXCLUSIVE%3a%20Suspension%20Of%20OSPOLY%20Rector" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./262413-how-register-sportpesa-fast-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Register Sportpesa Fast">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./customer-complains-about-mcdonalds-prices.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Customer Posts Video Complaining About McDonald's Raising the Prices on Its Food Items">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
