In 1961, at the age of 20, <a href=#>she married lawyer Andrew Stewart,</a> and gave birth to her only child, Alexis Stewart, in 1965. The pair split in the mid-'80s, and their divorce was finalized in 1990.</p><p>Martha subsequently <a href=#>dated actor Sir Anthony Hopkins</a> in the '90s but split with him after she watched The Silence of the Lambs.</p><p>When appearing on Howard Stern's radio show in 2006, Martha explained that she couldn't help but think of her then-beau as Hannibal Lecter.&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh, I loved him, but he was… scary. I was going to invite him up to Maine. I have this beautiful home in Maine, but then I reconsidered because I saw that movie again," she told the radio host. "Do you want someone eating your brain while you are sitting in your beautiful dining room in Maine?"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Martha Stewart with ex-boyfriend Charles Simonyi.</p></figure><p>She continued, "I would have probably had a very nice relationship with Anthony Hopkins, but I couldn’t get past the Lecter thing."</p><p>Martha also dated software billionaire Charles Simonyi for a whopping 15 years, beginning in 1993. The two stayed together through Martha's legal battles, and while she was in prison from 2004 to 2005.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Martha Stewart dating today? She is single, but ready to mingle.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Martha Stewart went on a "date" with Justin Bieber for 'Interview' in 2015.</p></figure><p>Following her split from Charles, Martha hasn't had any significant relationship that she's shared with the public. However, she has revealed that she is an online dater, and what her type is.</p><p>In 2013, she confirmed that she had made a Match.com profile, and that she had gone on a few dates, but that none had really panned out.</p><p>However, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>, in a December 2021 interview on Watch What Happens Live, Martha hinted that there's someone new in her romantic life, though she gave no details about who he is.</p><p>"I shouldn’t say no. I mean yes, but I’m not going to tell you," she said when asked about her relationship status. She suggested she thought she and her new beau were just friends, but then they became something more.</p><p>More recently, after appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition, Martha told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> that she has gotten some DMs, but she is not focused on dating.</p><p>"I've gotten a few inquiries. Just a couple," she said of potential dates, but that she is working hard. "You have to make time for certain things. My garden is very important... I have two amazing grandchildren."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Martha Stewart does have an ideal man in man...</h2><p>As the first-ever female self-made billionaire, you can't really fault Martha for having high expectations when it comes to her perfect man. On The Corp, she noted that she'd want a love interest to have multiple modes of transportation at his disposal.</p><p>"A boat would be nice. A plane would be nice too... I'd like a helicopter," she said on the show.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Martha Stewart (@marthastewart48)</a></p></figure><p>When she appeared on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wendy Williams Show </a>&nbsp;in December of 2016, the Martha Stewart Living founder also said that her dream man is on the younger side.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon being asked to describe her perfect match, she said that he would be "not older, definitely not older, about 10 years younger."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKaZoqm1onnSrZywmaKpeqWt06KloGWepMQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-martha-stewart-dating-now.html&text=Martha%20Stewart%20Is%20Single%2c%20but%20Her%20DMs%20Are%20Open&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-martha-stewart-dating-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-martha-stewart-dating-now.html&title=Martha%20Stewart%20Is%20Single%2c%20but%20Her%20DMs%20Are%20Open" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-martha-stewart-dating-now.html&title=Martha%20Stewart%20Is%20Single%2c%20but%20Her%20DMs%20Are%20Open" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-martha-stewart-dating-now.html&title=Martha%20Stewart%20Is%20Single%2c%20but%20Her%20DMs%20Are%20Open" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-martha-stewart-dating-now.html&description=Martha%20Stewart%20Is%20Single%2c%20but%20Her%20DMs%20Are%20Open" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./nick-cannon-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nick Cannon - Age, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./basketball-wives-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Basketball Wives - Cast, Ages, Trivia">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
