But, there is more to this lady than just her well-curved body. She has several accolades including being one of the youngest ladies ever to present Prime Time News.</p><p class=align-left>She was born on March 24th, 1992, in Nairobi, South C estate. Not much information is known about Kamene Goro <a href=#>family</a> except that she is a middle child amongst her three siblings, an elder brother and a young sister. Her sister's name is Natasha Goro. Her father is an engineer and her mother is a media specialist.</p><h3>Kamene Goro educational background</h3><p class=align-left>The Morning Kiss Show host is an epitome of beauty with brains. To add to her sparkling personality and curvy body, she holds an undergraduate degree in Law. She studied at the Rusinga International School before joining the University of Nairobi to pursue a degree in Law.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/32406cce4f5097e5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Michele Carey biography: The life and times of the El Dorado star</span></p></a><h3>Her illustrious career</h3><p class=align-left>It requires passion, courage, and a certain degree of intelligence for one to succeed in a career they did not pursue in college. Kamene is one example of such people. Although she holds a degree in Law, she has managed to conquer the airwaves in an exemplary fashion. But how did this come to be?</p><h4>Television career</h4><p class=align-left>While in her third year at the University of Nairobi, she got a chance to try out for a screen test on TV. This encounter would mark the genesis of her illustrious media career. At age 21, Kamene Goro was a Prime Time news anchor and reporter at the fast-growing media station - Ebru TV.</p><p class=align-left>She left the TV station in September 2015 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">but later rejoined</a> the company in 2017 and assumed the role of head of news. However, she left the station in late 2017. Some of the exciting television shows that she hosted while at Ebru TV include <i>Just the Facts</i>, <i>The Weekly Report</i>, and <i>Africa in Brief</i>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/12aa27019e1c27f6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Felicia Forbes: The story of Tommy 'Tiny' Lister's wife</span></p></a><h4>Radio career</h4><p class=align-left>Kamene then joined NRG Radio breakfast show, where she co-hosted with the controversial Andrew Kibe. In June 14th, 2019, the pair moved to Kiss 100 before Kibe resigned and was replaced by Jalang'o. Currently, the media personality co-hosts the Morning Kiss Show alongside Phelix Odiwour alias Jalang'o.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/5efdd3e7f15e9999.jpeg><p class=align-left>Before joining the media industry, Kamene worked as a paralegal at Simani & Co Advocate from February 2013 to July 2013. She then developed an interest in media and never looked back. However, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she remains open</a> and lives by God's guidance. She still loves the legal <a href=#>world</a>, and if fate takes her back there, then she will gladly accept.</p><p class=align-left>However, she admits that she loves where she is in life at the moment. Besides being a radio presenter, she is also an emcee, product promoter, and event host.</p><h3>Kamene Goro net worth</h3><p class=align-left>How much is Kamene Goro salary, and what is her net worth? She is reportedly worth a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">staggering Kenyan Shillings 7.5 million</a>. She has accumulated this amount of net worth, thanks to her flourishing careers.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/5f2f099629152f38.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jahira Dar bio: nationality, ethnicity, married, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The celebrated media personality is known to live a luxurious lifestyle, an indication that she has an attractive salary. However, she is yet to disclose her contract's details to the public despite numerous rumours that she<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> could be earning less</a> than the former hosts - Shaffie Weru and Adelle Onyango.</p><h3>Kamene Goro controversies</h3><p class=align-left>Like most media personalities, Kamene's career has not been a comfortable ride. Numerous controversies have marred it. However, the fact that she manages to shake most of them off and move on with her career is something that most people love her for.</p><h4>Her unceremonial departure from NRG</h4><p class=align-left>In July 2019, Miss Goro and her co-host Andrew Kibe made headlines when they unceremoniously left NRG (Energy) Radio to join Kiss 100. As a result, both<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> celebrities were sued</a> by their former employer over a non-compete clause in their contracts.</p><p class=align-left>The two resigned from <a href=#>NRG Radio</a> and paid their ex-employer three months salary in place of issuing a notice. However, according to the NRG application statement to the court, the period of three months was reasonable to restrain their former employees considering the substantial investment that had been made on them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/983b40415f243d8a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jeremy Rytky: What you should know about Andrea Barber's ex-husband</span></p></a><p class=align-left>While this was going on, she took to social media to highlight her challenges.

Where do I earn my living from? My career, my future...<p class=align-left>However, through the assistance of Radio Africaâ€™s CEO Patrick Quarcoo, the two were able to get back to the air and continue with their careers.</p><h4>Publicly declaring the number of men she had slept with</h4><p class=align-left>In 2018, the controversial radio presenter shocked her fans when she publicly declared the number of men she had slept with. At 26 years, Kamene claimed to have slept with 27 men, an allegation that attracted the attention of many followers.</p><p class=align-left>Kamene also got herself into a fight with socialite Huddah Monroe after she publicly claimed that Huddah was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a high-end prostitute</a>. This happened not once but twice, in less than a year. She said that there was no way Huddah could own a house and a posh car, without people knowing what her actual job was.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a67b0fe2dea34767.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Barbara Bain: husband, daughter, net worth, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><h4>Alleged sexual involvement with Andrew Kibe</h4><p class=align-left>In January 2020, there was an allegation that Miss Goro had slept with her then-co-host Andrew Kibe. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The rumours surfaced</a> after popular YouTuber Edgar Obare through his social media, claimed that he had been sent messages by his followers who claimed to have seen them getting intimate in a car.</p><p class=align-left>The allegation sparked a heated discussion online considering that Andrew and Kamene were co-hosts. However, to dismiss the rumours, the famous female radio presenter expressed her disappointment with the way people were misusing social media.</p>Humanity is gone everything has become about social media and the likes, and personally, I just want to live in a world where I'm just human.

She has only disclosed the name of one of her family members - Natasha, who is her young sister. Her parents are her most prominent critics and fans.</p><h3>Is Kamene Goro a Kamba?</h3><p class=align-left>This question seems to leave many of her fans with unsettling answers. Nonetheless, the celebrated Kiss 100 radio host <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">is a Kamba</a> damsel.</p><h3>Who is Kamene Goro husband?</h3><p class=align-left>She is currently not married. However, the Kiss 100 Radio presenter <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was married before</a> to a Tanzanian-based South African tycoon.
