Is Wike saying remove presidential candidate? Is Wike saying remove vice presidential candidate? So, what are you begging me for? All I am saying, and I will continue to say is that you have taken president, give us (national) chairman.</p><p>“Nobody wants to speak the truth. If I am saying remove the presidential candidate, if I am saying remove the vice-presidential candidate, then you will say why is he doing this,” the Rivers Governor said.</p><h2>Ayu Must Go</h2><p>Governor Wike insisted that the northern dominance of the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>PDP</a></strong> leadership is unacceptable saying the situation where the PDP presidential candidate, the national chairman and the Director-General of the presidential campaign council were all from the north is wrong.</p><p>He said he has accepted both Atiku and Okowa as presidential and vice presidential candidates respectively but Ayu must resign as he promised prior to the presidential primaries and be replaced by a southerner for peace to reign in the major opposition party.</p><p>Wike said: “He (national chairman) said if the presidential candidate comes from the north, he will resign, which means he has had this in mind. Now, the thing has come to reality, now resign, no. And people are saying go and talk to Wike.</p><p>“I’ve accepted the presidential candidate, I have accepted the vice-presidential candidate, what’s the problem again. You, fulfil your part. Let the South have something, that is all I’m preaching. You cannot have presidential candidate, national chairman, director general of the campaign.”</p><h2>It Is Foolish To Wait</h2><p>Speaking further, Wike said it is a foolish decision to wait till after the 2023 elections before insisting on justice for the south, saying now is the time when leverage can be used.</p><p>He said those praising the current PDP set up are no different from those sponsoring the Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket.</p><p>He insisted that those underrating him do so at their own peril.</p><p>The Governor said: “This is period that power game is being played. If you don’t have it now, forget it. If anybody tells you, let (Iyorchia) Ayu resign after election is conducted, then you are a foolish person. This is the time decision is being made.</p><p>“This is the time the presidential candidate, national chairman and the leader of campaign will sit, when election is won in February, before the president is sworn in, decisions would have been made.”</p><h2>I Will Support Cross River</h2><p>Wike also appreciated the contribution of the Cross River people during the PDP&nbsp;presidential primary, adding that he would also support them during the 2023 general election.</p><p>He said: “If there is nothing I achieved, I can go home and sleep that I won Cross River State. Not only did I win, I won very well. I feel so happy and that tells you of people who have character of steadfastness. People who will never be pushed around for whatever it is. People who believe in the principles of life, people who believe in fairness, justice and equity.</p><p>“This visit will spur me the more to give you support. I am not coming to Cross River to vote, but you are my friends. I have a right to support you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5BsZqmcoGKws7XSoqpmr5iWwW6t0Z5ksqelYq%2Bms8aipaBlnZp6p7vRZq6io5Visaq%2FwqWmrJ2jYryvuNhmq6Ghnpx6qbGMsJinrKNk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpdp-crisis-what-are-you-begging-me-for-wike-discloses-only-thing-he-wants.html&text=What%20Are%20You%20Begging%20Me%20For%3f%20Wike%20Discloses%20Only%20Thing%20He%20Wants&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpdp-crisis-what-are-you-begging-me-for-wike-discloses-only-thing-he-wants.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpdp-crisis-what-are-you-begging-me-for-wike-discloses-only-thing-he-wants.html&title=What%20Are%20You%20Begging%20Me%20For%3f%20Wike%20Discloses%20Only%20Thing%20He%20Wants" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpdp-crisis-what-are-you-begging-me-for-wike-discloses-only-thing-he-wants.html&title=What%20Are%20You%20Begging%20Me%20For%3f%20Wike%20Discloses%20Only%20Thing%20He%20Wants" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpdp-crisis-what-are-you-begging-me-for-wike-discloses-only-thing-he-wants.html&title=What%20Are%20You%20Begging%20Me%20For%3f%20Wike%20Discloses%20Only%20Thing%20He%20Wants" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpdp-crisis-what-are-you-begging-me-for-wike-discloses-only-thing-he-wants.html&description=What%20Are%20You%20Begging%20Me%20For%3f%20Wike%20Discloses%20Only%20Thing%20He%20Wants" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-wike-met-with-atiku-after-meeting-with-tinubu-in-london.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Why Wike Met With Atiku After Meeting With Tinubu In London'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./relationship-spreadsheet.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="This Man's Girlfriend Created an Extensive Spreadsheet About Him and Their Relationship">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
