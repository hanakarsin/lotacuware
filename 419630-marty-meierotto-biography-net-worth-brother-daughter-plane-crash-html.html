After completing his high school education, he ventured into the industry as a full-time trapper. Unfortunately, it was difficult to perform his work in North Wisconsin because there were few animals to catch, making the competition high.</p><p class=align-left>As a result, he decided to search for a place with an abundance of animals.

However, as time went by, he continued falling in love with the land. Marty started doing several odd jobs to earn more money that will in return help in his trapping venture.</p><p class=align-left>He started working as a janitor in Fairbanks. He also took <a href=#>construction</a> and logging jobs to make more money for food and buy his first trap and tent. This would enable him to go trapping during his free time.
