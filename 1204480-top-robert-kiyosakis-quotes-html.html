As a lot of people can explain who they’d become rich, but only a few know why they are still poor.</p><h2>Robert Kiyosaki's famous quotes</h2>Emotions are what make us human. Make us real. The word 'emotion' stands for energy in motion. Be truthful about your emotions, and use your mind and emotions in your favor, not against yourself.― Robert T. Kiyosaki, Rich Dad, Poor DadThe single most powerful asset we all have is our mind. If it is trained well, it can create enormous wealth in what seems to be an instant. ― Robert T. Kiyosaki, Rich Dad, Poor Dad<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/62ec29c5f5f2fd93.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50 sad anime quotes about life, love, pain and loneliness</span></p></a>Workers work hard enough to not be fired, and owners pay just enough so that workers won't quit. ― Robert T. Kiyosaki, Rich Dad, Poor DadIf you realize that you're the problem, then you can change yourself, learn something and grow wiser. Don't blame other people for your problems. ― Robert Kiyosaki, Rich Dad, Poor Dad<p class=align-left>If you really want to learn the attitude of how to handle risk, losing and failure, go to San Antonio and visit the Alamo. The Alamo is a great story of brave people who chose to fight, knowing there was no hope of success against overwhelming odds. They chose to die instead of surrendering. It's an inspiring story worthy of study; nonetheless, it's still a tragic military defeat. They got their b*tts kicked. A failure if you will. They lost. So how do Texans handle failure? They still shout, "Remember the Alamo!"</p>That's why I like Texans so much. They took a great failure and turned it into a tourist destination that makes them millions. Texans don't bury their failures. They get inspired by them. They take their failures and turn them into rallying cries. Failure inspires Texans to become winners. But that formula is not just the formula for Texans. It is formula for all winners. ― Robert Kiyosaki, Rich Dad, Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Children About Money That the Poor and Middle Class Don't<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5f0f8e1d7bf9b24d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing Harley Quinn quotes from the iconic DC character</span></p></a>As I said, I wish I could say it was easy. It wasn't, but it wasn't hard either. But without a strong reason or purpose, anything in life is hard. ― Robert T. Kiyosaki, Rich Dad, Poor DadI am concerned that too many people are focused too much on money and not on their greatest wealth, which is their education. If people are prepared to be flexible, keep an open mind and learn, they will grow richer and richer through the changes. If they think money will solve the problems, I am afraid those people will have a rough ride. Intelligence solves problems and produces money. Money without financial intelligence is money soon gone. ― Robert T. Kiyosaki, Rich Dad, Poor Dad<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/62ec29c5f5f2fd93.png><p class=align-left>Photo: 24smi</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Savage quotes about fake friends</p>To know a little about a lot. ― Robert T. Kiyosaki, Rich Dad, Poor DadIt is said that the fear of public speaking is a fear greater than death for most people. According to psychiatrists, the fear of public speaking is caused by the fear of ostracism, the fear of standing out, the fear of criticism, the fear of ridicule, the fear of being an outcast. THE FEAR OF BEING DIFFERENT PREVENTS MOST PEOPLE FROM SEEKING NEW WAYS TO SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS. ― Robert T.

That is true for money, a smile, love, friendship. I know it is often the last thing a person may want to do, but it has always worked for me. I just trust that the principle of reciprocity is true, and I give what I want. ― Robert T. Kiyosaki, Rich Dad, Poor DadI find so many people struggling, often working harder, simply because they cling to old ideas. They want things to be the way they were; they resist change. I know people who are losing their jobs or their houses, and they blame technology or the economy or their boss. Sadly they fail to realize that they might be the problem. Old ideas are their biggest liability. It is a liability simply because they fail to realize that while that idea or way of doing something was an asset yesterday, yesterday is gone. ― Robert T.

Yet, the one thing that holds all of us back is some degree of self-doubt. It is not so much the lack of technical information that holds us back, but more the lack of self-confidence. ― Robert T. Kiyosaki, Rich Dad, Poor DadFOCUS - Follow One Course Until Successful ― Robert Kiyosaki, Why We Want You To Be RichThe power of "can't": The word "can't" makes strong people weak, blinds people who can see, saddens happy people, turns brave people into cowards, robs a genius of their brilliance, causes rich people to think poorly, and limits the achievements of that great person living inside us all. ― Robert T.

Most people want everyone else in the world to change themselves. Let me tell you, it's easier to change yourself than everyone else. ― Robert Kiyosaki, Rich Dad, Poor DadJust know that it’s fear that keeps most people working at a job. The fear of not paying their bills. The fear of being fired. The fear of not having enough money. The fear of starting over. That’s the price of studying to learn a profession or trade, and then working for money. Most people become a slave to money… and then get angry at their boss. ― Robert T.
