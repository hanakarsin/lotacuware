You see, the mom was chopping her daughter's hair off as a way to discipline her.</p><p>She took to the camera to explain that her daughter “thinks it’s more important to be pretty than educated, more important to be a follower than a leader.” And while the mother filming the TikTok noted that she's "not a parent who likes to use physical discipline," she did do quite a number on her daughter's tresses.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>As she took out her scissors to begin chopping, the teen objected — however, there was no going back for this mama.</p><p>"You had your warning, you had your chance. I told you to listen, I told you to stop disobeying my rules," the mom said as she rotated around her daughter's head, snipping entire braids off.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I told you being cute ain’t s--t if you have no education. I told you to stop disobeying me, I told you to listen and do as you’re supposed to, I told you to do good in school, I told you to do your daily routine,” the mom continued. “You’re sadly mistaken because you thought being pretty was so much better than being educated or listening to your mom, right," she said as she finished up.</p><p>Then she showed off her daughter's remaining hair to the camera and said, "this is what happens when you don't listen to your mom."</p><p>But the story didn't just end right there. In a follow-up video, the mom asked her daughter on camera if she felt she’d been abused. The teen answered, "No.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>These TikTok videos have since been deleted, but the conversation around this mom's actions is still ripe. Most viewers believed what that woman was doing to her daughter was wrong.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>And even though giving someone a haircut isn't technically thought of as physical abuse, many commenters felt in this situation, it could qualify.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The mom didn’t beat her but I’m pretty sure this is still a physical punishment</p>— Alysha (@RealAlysha) <a href=#>December 13, 2022</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Other folks argued that chopping her daughter's hair off would only make the teen feel insecure about herself, especially since she's at an age when she is already so vulnerable.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>When mothers cut their daughters hair off as a form of “punishment”, it’s never about teaching a lesson.
