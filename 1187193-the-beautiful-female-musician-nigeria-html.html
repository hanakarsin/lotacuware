She once told Nigeria’s Vanguard, <i>“Back in America, we have the likes of Beyonce, Nicky Minaj, Mariah Carey and other female acts standing tall. So why would there be just one person shining here? After all, here in Nigeria, we have male acts like Davido, Wizkid, M.I, Tuface and other big names at the same time. It’s not fair to have just one female act in the industry. So, I’m glad that more female acts are springing up. Having more female acts in the industry will open more doors.”</i></li><li><strong>She’s worked with incredible artists. </strong>Savage has worked with and written for some amazing artists like Monica, Fantasia, Mary J. Blige, and Whitney Houston, singing background vocals on the late icon’s I Look To You.</li><li><strong>She attended the University of Kent and Berklee College of Music. </strong>Her parents were initially hesitant about her decision to pursue music, so to quell their fears she decided to study Business Administration at the University of Kent.

Adding that her son was her biggest motivation, she told Fashion Bomb TV, <i>“Before I used to work hard, now there’s a reason. I want to leave a legacy.
