Others were those that were awaiting trial, but because of the long time that they have been involved and in line with the protocol or the procedure for handling anyone who has been exposed to terrorism or related offenses, the procedure for them to be taken through a process of de-radicalization.”</p><p>According to Daily Trust, the&nbsp;agreement between the applicants signed between the Attorney-General of the Federation, the respondents and the Legal Aid Council, which represented the applicants, were approved and adopted as judgements before three separate High Court judges in Lagos.</p><p>The orders for their release, according to a document made available on Saturday, were given on October 4 and 5 by Justices Awogboro Olawunmi, Tijjani Garba Ringim and Nicholas Oweibo.</p><h2>Raid And Detention</h2><p>The suspects were detained after they were&nbsp;arrested at various times in Bauchi, Maiduguri and Kano in 2009 on suspicion of being members of Boko Haram.</p><p>This happened when police and other security agencies embarked on operations aimed at taming the uprising staged by Boko Haram members, led by <strong>Mohammed Yusuf</strong>.</p><p>Since then, the suspects had been in detention with no hope of freedom until recently.</p><p>“There is no iota of truth in the alleged prisoner swap. The terrorists who released the last set of the train victims have nothing to do with the 101 people released from Kirikiri. Those people in Kirikiri were not Boko Haram members. There was no evidence to nail them.</p><p>“The terrorists that attacked the Abuja-Kaduna train had set their members free during the invasion of Kuje prison in Abuja. Those people freed from Kirikiri have no value to the terrorists. It was just a coincidence that their release nearly coincided with the release of the train victims,” a source close to the military in Maiduguri, Borno State, said.</p><p>Also speaking, an official of the Legal Aid Council said the detainees were arrested by the police at various places in Maiduguri, Kano and Bauchi states.</p><p>“Some of the suspects were arrested in raids by the police in their homes, business premises, mosques or highways,’’ he said.</p><p>“They were separately detained in correctional centres in Kano, Maiduguri and Bauchi pending the time they would meet their bail conditions. However, in March 2011 they were all herded into a truck and moved to Lagos.</p><p>“We have 74 being detained in the Kirikiri Maximum Correctional Centre, while 27 are detained in Kirikiri Medium Correctional Centre,” he said.</p><h2>Debriefing And Deradicalisation</h2><p>A top official of the Council denied a trending statement on the social media that their release was part of the terms of negotiations for the release of 23 <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Abuja-Kaduna train hostages</a></strong>.</p><p>“This is balderdash. It is a tissue of lies. They were released by a court order,’’ the official who craved anonymity told Daily Trust Saturday.</p><p>He also confirmed that upon their release, the military took them to Gombe for debriefing and deradicalisation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5BuZqKmo56xpnnDnquaoZyoerC6jLCfsmWSqrWivshmnqiupGK%2FprjEmqqenF1mfXJ5zairqKqZpMK0ecGooqhlmJa%2FormMrKysqJWYwbR5xaumpmWbnr%2Bqt8iroGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2finside-details-on-why-buhari-govt-released-101-notorious-boko-haram-suspects-from-kirikiri.html&text=Inside%20Details%20On%20Why%20Buhari%20Govt%20Released%20101%20%27Notorious%20Boko%20Haram%27%20Suspects%20From%20Kirikiri&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-details-on-why-buhari-govt-released-101-notorious-boko-haram-suspects-from-kirikiri.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-details-on-why-buhari-govt-released-101-notorious-boko-haram-suspects-from-kirikiri.html&title=Inside%20Details%20On%20Why%20Buhari%20Govt%20Released%20101%20%27Notorious%20Boko%20Haram%27%20Suspects%20From%20Kirikiri" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2finside-details-on-why-buhari-govt-released-101-notorious-boko-haram-suspects-from-kirikiri.html&title=Inside%20Details%20On%20Why%20Buhari%20Govt%20Released%20101%20%27Notorious%20Boko%20Haram%27%20Suspects%20From%20Kirikiri" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2finside-details-on-why-buhari-govt-released-101-notorious-boko-haram-suspects-from-kirikiri.html&title=Inside%20Details%20On%20Why%20Buhari%20Govt%20Released%20101%20%27Notorious%20Boko%20Haram%27%20Suspects%20From%20Kirikiri" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-details-on-why-buhari-govt-released-101-notorious-boko-haram-suspects-from-kirikiri.html&description=Inside%20Details%20On%20Why%20Buhari%20Govt%20Released%20101%20%27Notorious%20Boko%20Haram%27%20Suspects%20From%20Kirikiri" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1300239-robert-lewandowski-bayern-star-leads-race-europes-golden-boot-award-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Robert Lewandowski: Bayern star leads race for Europe's Golden Boot award">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ron-jones-tvactor-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ron Cephas Jones - Trivia, Family, Bio">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
