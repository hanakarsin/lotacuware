style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Good morning Nigeria, welcome to Naija News roundup of top newspapers headlines in Nigeria for today, Thursday, 30th December 2021</h2><p>President Muhammadu Buhari has promised that his administration will address without hesitation issues relating to foreign exchange and importation of raw materials and machines that are not available locally.</p><p>Naija News understands that the number one citizen of Nigeria on Wednesday reiterated his government’s commitment towards growing manufacturing activities in the country when he played host to the leadership of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.</p><p>Addressing MAN in a statement made available to newsmen today shortly after playing host to the business-oriented group, President Buhari said the relevant ministry would revisit MAN’s concerns about the increase in excise duties on the identified products and other tariff-related matters.</p><p>The communique issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, also assured MAN that Nigeria will take steps to fully maximize the benefits of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).</p><p>Hamza Al- Mustapha, former Chief Security Officer to the late dictator, General Sani Abacha, has revealed those behind the security challenges in the country.</p><p>In an interview with VOA Hausa on Wednesday, Al-Mustapha alleged that wealthy Nigerians with access to weapons and hard drugs were sponsors of insecurity in the nation.</p><p>He claimed that few individuals in the country are benefitting from the country’s mineral resources and they seemed to be unstoppable.</p><p>Al-Mustapha stated that the solution to the insecurity issues would require that the federal government go after the sponsors of terrorism.</p><p>Katsina State Governor, Aminu Masari has submitted that residents have to arise and defend themselves against insecurity as security operatives appear limited.</p><p>The Governor of President Muhammadu Buhari’s home state said the number of security operatives available is not enough to adequately tackle and curb attacks from the terrorists, bandits, and other insurgents.</p><p>He, therefore, told residents of the state to get weapons to defend themselves and family members from attacks.</p><p>Naija News reports the Governor made the submission on Tuesday during a media parley with journalists at the Government House in Katsina.</p><p>Masari argued that it is surprising for bandits and criminals to possess guns while law-abiding citizens find it difficult to get guns for self-defence.</p><p>He, therefore, promised that his government will assist residents to get approved weapons for self-defence and ensure such weapons are registered with the police to avoid abuse.</p><p>The Governor added that the current administration has taken action by recruiting more security operatives but the numbers are still far below expectations.</p><p>The Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, on Wednesday cautioned the police in the state against harassment, intimidation, and extortion of residents if they wanted to be respected.</p><p>Dr. Obasa said this on the floor of the House when the lawmakers honoured the outgoing Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, who has been promoted to the rank of Assistant Inspector-General of Police and due to retire in January 2022.</p><p>Obasa said Odumosu was honoured as the first commissioner of police in the state to stand before the lawmakers in the hallowed chamber and address Lagosians on his experience and issues with policing Lagos because he is considered to have effectively managed the security of the state.</p><p>The Speaker thanked Odumosu for his openness and responsiveness each time there were issues affecting the peace of the state.</p><p>Yomi Aliyu, lawyer to Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemi, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, has denied alleged plans to assassinate his client.</p><p>He made the denial in a chat with Vanguard on Wednesday while reacting to alleged claims by a spokesman for the agitator, Olayomi Koiki, that the Muhammadu Buhari government is plotting to eliminate Sunday Igboho in Benin Republic.</p><p>Aliyu said he was in constant communication with Sunday Igboho’s wife, adding that he doesn’t have such knowledge of plans to eliminate his client.</p><p>He, however, revealed plans to hold the federal government accountable if anything should happen to Sunday Igboho in detention.</p><p>The traditional ruler of Gada community in Bungudu Local Government Area of Zamfara State, Umaru Bawan-Allah, has been killed by bandits during an invasion of the area.</p><p>Naija News gathered that the gunmen invaded the community around 1 a.m. on Wednesday and killed three other people during the attack.</p><p>Confirming the attack, the Secretary, Bungudu Emirate Council, Usman Ahmad, said the gunmen operated for about four hours, unleashing mayhem on residents of the area.</p><p>He disclosed that the bandits set fire on the foodstuff and vehicles parked in the palace of the traditional ruler.</p><p>Ahmad said the monarch and the other victims will be buried by 4pm on Wednesday according to the Islamic rites.</p><p>The Federal Government has rejected the autopsy report on the cause of death of Itunu Babalola, the Nigerian lady who died in Côte d’Ivoire after she was wrongly jailed.</p><p>Chairperson, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM), Abike Dabiri-Erewa, rejected the report at a meeting with the father of the deceased, Emmanuel Babalola, at the commission’s office in Lagos.</p><p>Speaking at the meeting on Tuesday, Dabiri-Erewa, who expressed deepest condolences to Babalola’s family, said that the autopsy left so many questions unanswered.</p><p>Dabiri-Erewa urged the media to keep the matter on the front burner to ensure that the case was investigated and brought to a logical conclusion for the deceased to get justice.</p><p>Earlier, Mr Babalola, who commended the Federal Government’s efforts to get her late daughter released from the prison before she died as well as getting the corpse released.</p><p>President Muhammadu Buhari’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, has released an update on his COVID-19 infection.</p><p>The top government official and some other persons in the Presidential Villa, Abuja were earlier in the week confirmed positive with the dreaded coronavirus disease, Naija News recalls.</p><p>Other officials reportedly affected by the virus include the permanent secretary in the State House, Tijani Umar; the President’s Aide-de-camp (ADC), Yusuf Dodo; his chief security officer (CSO), Aliyu Musa and the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, among others.</p><p>Giving an update on his status in a post on social media on Wednesday, Garba Shehu said he is now healed of the viral infection.</p><p>Thanking God for his speedy recovery from the virus, Shehu prayed for the recovery of other Nigerians who are still afflicted with the virus.</p><p>Gunmen suspected to be bandits who abducted the paramount ruler of Pyem Chiefdom in Plateau State, Charles Mato Dakat have demanded the sum of ₦50m for his release.</p><p>According to a palace source, the kidnappers called the family members through the king’s phone and made their demands known.</p><p>Naija News recalls the monarch’s palace was attacked in the wee hours of Sunday morning, 26th December by gunmen.</p><p>The source quoted on condition of anonymity by The Nation said the family negotiated to pay the sum of ₦30m but the kidnappers have not made their stand known after promising to get back.</p><p>The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has appointed Portuguese coach, Jose Peseiro, as the new head coach of the Super Eagles.</p><p>NFF made this known in a communique on Wednesday after its National Executive Council meeting.</p><p>“After careful consideration of a memo presented by Chairman of the Technical and Development Sub-Committee, the Executive Committee endorsed a proposal for the appointment of Mr Jose Peseiro as the new Head Coach of the Super Eagles, following the end to the relationship with Mr Gernot Rohr,” the NFF communique read in part</p><p>Naija News gathered that Peseiro will not be leading the Super Eagles to the AFCON 2022 in Cameroon, but the interim coach, Augustine Eguavoen, will be in charge of the team at the Nations Cup.</p><h2><strong>Those are the top Nigerian newspapers headlines for today.
