Kaduna State has been ravaged, the state has never heard this experience, we have never seen it even during the civil war. Yes there has been a religious crisis in the past here and there but with the number of human beings that have been gruesomely murdered, we are not talking of a situation where people are fighting each other no, we are talking of where citizens sleeping in their homes are rounded up and killed,”&nbsp;Daily Post quoted Jacob as saying.</p><p>Reiterating his claims, Jacob said: “Now someone may ask, how is it an <strong>APC problem?</strong> Are they the ones that are killing the people and l said very bluntly, that the responsibility and the primary function of the government is to provide security of lives and properties of the people.”</p><p>”It is only the government that is protected and given the right to use force to protect citizens or for any purpose.</p><p>”Today, we have seen a situation where the government of Nigeria, particularly, Kaduna State principally from the year 2016, 2017, 2018 to date that the killings started in the era of this government and government treated everything with light mindset purposely because the killings were happening in the Southern part of the state.”</p><p>The politician condemned in totality Governor El-Rufai’s approach to the situations in the state, describing it as an embarrassing, undemocratic way of addressing things.</p><p>Jacob added: “everybody knows and the records are there for everybody to see that the government of Kaduna State was hostile to the victims, the government failed and said it was the victims that were responsible for the killings.</p><p>“We have it on record where the governor and officials of government will say that Churches, Church leaders and traditional rulers are behind the killings in Southern Kaduna. People in government bluntly and cruelly said so and even vowed to deal with all the Church leaders.”</p><p>Jacob stressed that the government’s approach to the lingering issues is poor.</p><p>He said the Kaduna State government was comforted in telling people stories and by telling the whole world that the killings in Southern Kaduna were largely reprisals from the so-called killing of foreign Fulanis in 2011.</p><p>“We were in the city in 2011 when the crisis broke out, it was not a Southern Kaduna issue, it was started here in the city when aggrieved persons who lost the 2011 presidential election went out armed with guns and cutlasses and targeted all persons they perceived to be PDP members or followers and it spread from Kaduna North and Kaduna South and to other parts of the state and people were killed, properties were destroyed. It continued for two days in Kaduna and other northern cities,”&nbsp;the legal practitioner explained.</p><p>He added: ”Southern Kaduna communities also joined in the protest and started burning and looting people’s properties, an area that is predominantly a PDP area. That was what also caused the problem in the Southern Kaduna because the minorities also perceived that they lost the election and because the massive followers of the PDP had surprisingly launched attacks against the majority and that was when people in Southern Kaduna also reacted.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze49rZpqok2K%2Fpr%2FPqKWsoZKhsm6yzqtkpKGcobavs9Jmmquho57AbrXNZqKanKWjrm6%2FwLKqZqiUpXqnu9GmnKtlnJq0oriMmpuvoaOav3A%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fapc-responsible-for-killings-crisis-in-kaduna-says-pdp-former-legal-adviser.html&text=APC%20%27Responsible%27%20For%20Killings%2c%20Crisis%20In%20Kaduna%20%20Says%20PDP%20Former%20Legal%20Adviser&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fapc-responsible-for-killings-crisis-in-kaduna-says-pdp-former-legal-adviser.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fapc-responsible-for-killings-crisis-in-kaduna-says-pdp-former-legal-adviser.html&title=APC%20%27Responsible%27%20For%20Killings%2c%20Crisis%20In%20Kaduna%20%20Says%20PDP%20Former%20Legal%20Adviser" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fapc-responsible-for-killings-crisis-in-kaduna-says-pdp-former-legal-adviser.html&title=APC%20%27Responsible%27%20For%20Killings%2c%20Crisis%20In%20Kaduna%20%20Says%20PDP%20Former%20Legal%20Adviser" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fapc-responsible-for-killings-crisis-in-kaduna-says-pdp-former-legal-adviser.html&title=APC%20%27Responsible%27%20For%20Killings%2c%20Crisis%20In%20Kaduna%20%20Says%20PDP%20Former%20Legal%20Adviser" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fapc-responsible-for-killings-crisis-in-kaduna-says-pdp-former-legal-adviser.html&description=APC%20%27Responsible%27%20For%20Killings%2c%20Crisis%20In%20Kaduna%20%20Says%20PDP%20Former%20Legal%20Adviser" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1082849-biafra-supporters-visit-trump-towers-new-york-photos-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Biafra supporters visit Trump Towers in New York (photos)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tope-alabi-speaks-on-controversy-over-song-lyrics-aboru-aboye.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tope Alabi Speaks On Controversy Over Song Lyrics, 'Aboru Aboye'">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
