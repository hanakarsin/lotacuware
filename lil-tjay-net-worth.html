The South Bronx, N.Y. native, born Tionne Jayden Merrit, and his friends allegedly got attacked by a man named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mohamed Konate</a> while attending a shopping center in Edgewater, N.J.</p><p>Lil Tjay went to the hospital for emergency surgery, and reports have surfaced about his status following the shooting. Several reports claimed that the shooting left the 22-year-old artist brain dead or paralyzed, but those have proven to be false.</p><p>At the time of this writing, Lil Tjay is in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stable condition</a>. As fans await more information regarding the "Brothers" rapper's health, some wonder how he rose to fame and how much money he’s made throughout his career.

He accumulated a fortune through his solo rap career, which kicked off in 2018. That year, Lil Tjay inked a deal with Columbia Records and released his first single, “Resume,” and his debut EP, "No Comparison." Then, in 2019, his career expanded after dropping his second project, "F.N.," and earning a spot on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Lil Tjay</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Rapper</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $600,000</p><p>Lil Tjay is a rapper who rose to fame in 2018 with his first big hit, "Resume."

In 2021, he collaborated with French Montana and Blueface on two singles — “Slide” and “Bag Season.” Lil Tjay has also worked alongside Pretty Much, Don Q, and Yung Bans.</p><p>Since his music took off, he’s also been linked to several influencers and rappers romantically. Lil Tjay and Rubi Rose reportedly briefly dated before setting his eyes on her best friend, influencer <a href=#>Lala Baptiste</a>. In October 2020, though, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HotNewHipHop</a> also stated he cheated on Lala with Trippie Redd and 6ix9ine’s ex, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ayleks</a>.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lil Tjay began his rap career in a juvenile prison.</h2><p>Although he credits artists like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Jackson and Usher</a> as his musical icons, Lil Tjay set his sights on rap music following a run-in with the law.

When he left the juvenile detention center in 2017, he released “Resume,” and the rest is history.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>While “Resume” earned Lil Tjay over 14 million streams almost instantly, he expressed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">XXL</a> that he didn’t think he received enough recognition for his music.</p><p>“I feel like all my songs slept on,” Lil Tjay admitted in January 2019. “I'm not complainin', but I just wanna drop more heat.
