Erin is also a co-host on Dancing With the Stars, and has consistently taken advantage of her skills as a journalist to advance her career. Before she was a hugely successful TV personality, though, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Erin</a> was standing on the sidelines of big games for a totally different reason.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Erin Andrews used to be a cheerleader in Florida.</h2><p>Before her illustrious career as a journalist, she was a dancer for the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Florida Gators</a> in a group called the Dazzlers. Erin was a member of the group throughout her years in college, and performed at a number of high-profile college games as a member of the team. Little did she know that her time with the troupe would be just the beginning of a long career in sports.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The broadcaster and TV host was born in Maine, but spent the majority of her childhood in Florida. She followed in her father’s footsteps in choosing to become a broadcast journalist, and also said that she was a tomboy when she was younger.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her life</a> began revolving around sports at a very young age, when she would watch Boston Celtics games with her father. Because she was a tomboy, she apparently didn’t have many female friends growing up. Instead, she hung out with the boys and talked about sports. She also looked up to a number of other female sports journalists as she was growing up.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Erin was also in a sorority in college.</h2><p>While she was attending the University of Florida, Erin was also a member of the Zeta Tau Alpha <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sorority</a>. Following her graduation, Erin immediately began working for Fox Sports Florida as a freelance reporter. From 2000 to 2004, she covered a variety of Florida and Atlanta teams for local stations, and quickly proved herself to be a capable reporter.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Tournament memories ‘00!!

From there, she began reporting on college football games, did sideline reporting for Major League Baseball games, and also reported on things like the Scripps National Spelling Bee and the Little League World Series.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Today, Erin works at Fox Sports and has diversified her broadcasting skills.</h2><p>Although Erin remains a successful sports journalist with Fox Sports, which she joined in 2012, she’s also begun to take on assignments that are less directly connected to the world of sports. She’s now a co-host on Dancing With the Stars, and she’s also co-hosted the CMT Music Awards. Now that she’s close to a household name, Erin is trying to extend the types of projects she’s capable of taking on.&nbsp;</p><p>Even as she‘s continued to further her career, she’s also been associated with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">viral moments</a> where athletes seem to make moves on her. Although she may not be interested in dating a pro-athlete, she’s proved that she’s more than capable of covering them.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmr%2BquoyapZ2qlazAbrLLqKminJFisKmxxKujnpmUmr8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ferin-andrews-florida-cheerleader.html&text=Erin%20Andrews%20Was%20a%20Cheerleader%20in%20Florida%20Before%20She%20Was%20a%20Reporter&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ferin-andrews-florida-cheerleader.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ferin-andrews-florida-cheerleader.html&title=Erin%20Andrews%20Was%20a%20Cheerleader%20in%20Florida%20Before%20She%20Was%20a%20Reporter" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ferin-andrews-florida-cheerleader.html&title=Erin%20Andrews%20Was%20a%20Cheerleader%20in%20Florida%20Before%20She%20Was%20a%20Reporter" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ferin-andrews-florida-cheerleader.html&title=Erin%20Andrews%20Was%20a%20Cheerleader%20in%20Florida%20Before%20She%20Was%20a%20Reporter" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ferin-andrews-florida-cheerleader.html&description=Erin%20Andrews%20Was%20a%20Cheerleader%20in%20Florida%20Before%20She%20Was%20a%20Reporter" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./esteban-loaiza-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Esteban Loaiza - Age, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ducky-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ducky - Age, Family, Bio">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
