They have put up a united front and have been picking off all the rookies one by one, sending them down to the liar to get deactivated and sent home.</p><p>However, a few strong rookies are still left in the game — one of them being Logan Sampedro. Logan has been doing well, but in Episode 11 that aired on Oct. 20, he was seen telling the cameras about a leg injury. In Episode 10, he said that he had felt a strain in his leg while competing in a daily challenge. Before long, the rest of the contestants knew that Logan was competing with an injury, making him a target for elimination.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: MTV</span></figure><p>Logan was worried that he would go down in the liar, but fellow rookie Ed Eason saved him. Ed said it wouldn’t be fair for Logan to battle it out in an elimination game, so he ended up throwing himself in the ring and was eliminated by vet <a href=#>Kyle Christie</a> in pole wrestle. Logan was saved but is still wounded. Does he end up disqualified because of his leg? See if he ends up leaving The Challenge: Lies, Spies, & Allies because of his injury.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Does Logan leave Season 37 of 'The Challenge'?</h2><p>Logan does leave The Challenge: Lies, Spies, & Allies, but it wasn't for getting disqualified due to his leg injury. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Challenge Season 37 spoilers</a>, Logan actually competes for a while and goes down into the liar against veteran competitor Cory Wharton. He wins and sends Cory packing. When he faces Cory in the elimination, Logan is likely still dealing with leg pain. Unfortunately, Logan does not make it to the final to compete for the big money.</p><p>What sends Logan home is when he goes up against fellow rookie Emanuel Neagu in elimination and loses. Logan may not have left the game because of his leg, but two other competitors were sent home from The Challenge due to injuries this season.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: MTV</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Which competitors had to leave due to injury on 'The Challenge'?</h2><p>Aneesa Ferreira and Tommy Sheehan both exited the series early after getting hurt pretty badly during daily challenges. Aneesa hurt her shoulder after falling off a climbing wall in Episode 4 and was not medically cleared to continue. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a>, she revealed that it was the worst injury she had ever experienced. She shared, "I dislocated my left shoulder. Any way you cut it, it's the most painful injury I've ever endured in my life. Ever."</p><p>Anessa went on to say, "I wish it upon no one. And watching it brings back that initial hurt. God, that really hurt. It definitely was devastating."</p><p>Tommy was disqualified during Episode 3 after getting a concussion. In an interview also with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">EW</a>, he stated, "It's tough to go out that way. Personally, I'd much rather have lost or gone out even in elimination, because with an injury it's always like if I didn't get injured, what could have happened?"</p><p>The Challenge: Spies, Lies, and Allies airs Wednesday at 8 p.m. EST on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4ylpqCZnmK5pq3VnmStoJVisKmty6Wcp5%2BV</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdoes-logan-leave-the-challenge.html&text=Does%20Rookie%20Logan%20Sampedro%20Leave%20MTV%27s%20%27The%20Challenge%27%20Due%20to%20Injury%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoes-logan-leave-the-challenge.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-logan-leave-the-challenge.html&title=Does%20Rookie%20Logan%20Sampedro%20Leave%20MTV%27s%20%27The%20Challenge%27%20Due%20to%20Injury%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdoes-logan-leave-the-challenge.html&title=Does%20Rookie%20Logan%20Sampedro%20Leave%20MTV%27s%20%27The%20Challenge%27%20Due%20to%20Injury%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-logan-leave-the-challenge.html&title=Does%20Rookie%20Logan%20Sampedro%20Leave%20MTV%27s%20%27The%20Challenge%27%20Due%20to%20Injury%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoes-logan-leave-the-challenge.html&description=Does%20Rookie%20Logan%20Sampedro%20Leave%20MTV%27s%20%27The%20Challenge%27%20Due%20to%20Injury%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./65949-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michelle Obama Joins Worldwide Protest Over Missing Nigerian Schoolgirls">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./50-cent-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="50 Cent - Age, Family, Bio">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
