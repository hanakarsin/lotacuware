Muhammadu Buhari</p><p>Buhari on Friday <a href=# rel=noopener>addressed the nation as Nigeria celebrated her 61st independence from Britain</a>.</p><p>The president, during his speech, came hard on sponsors of separatist agitations in the country, accusing them of abandoning their national leadership positions for their selfish gains.</p><p>Buhari disclosed that a member of the<a href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;National Assembly has been identified as sponsor of separatist agitation</a>.</p><p>He stated that this came to light following the arrests of leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu and Yoruba nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, alias Igboho.</p><p>According to Buhari, “The recent arrests of Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Adeyemo, and the ongoing investigations being conducted have revealed certain high-profile financiers behind these individuals.</p><p>“We are vigorously pursuing these financiers including one identified as a serving member of the National Assembly.</p><p>“This is a clear example of how people abandon their national leadership positions for their selfish gains.”</p><p>The president also insisted that Nigeria’s unity is non-negotiable.</p><h2>Attacks</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-390999 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Adebanjo.jpg alt

speech did not go down with some persons, with the convener of the Concerned Nigrian’s, Deji Adeyanju, <a href=# rel=noopener>describing the Buhari-led government as the worst in Nigeria’s history</a>.</p><p>He condemned the President for praising the military in his Independence Day statement despite the killings and insecurity across the country.</p><p>Adeyanju accused Buhari of not revealing the sponsors of Boko Haram terrorists, while he claim to know the sponsors of the Indigenous People of Biafra and Yoruba Nation.</p><p>Similarly, the leader of social-political group Afenifere, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, described President Buhari as <a href=# rel=noopener>ignorant over his Independence Day nationwide broadcast</a>.</p><p>Reacting in a chat on Friday, Pa Adebanjo stated that Buhari was talking nonsense as he was a small boy when the country’s independence and unity was being negotiated in the 1950s.</p><p>According to the 93-year old Afenifere leader, in 1953 when the North opposed the call for Independence and rather advocated ‘Araba’ (secession), Obafemi Awolowo and Nnamdi Azikiwe convinced the northern leadership headed by Ahmadu Bello, to negotiate the terms of their unity and ultimately their independence from British rule.</p><h2>PDP governors surprisingly zone chairmanship to north</h2><img decoding=async

earlier report published by Naija News that the <a href=# rel=noopener>governors of the PDP voted to zone the party’s national chairmanship ticket to the north</a>.</p><p>The decision to zone the

week asked President Buhari to <a href=# rel=noopener>stop treating bandits and kidnappers in the country with kid gloves</a>.</p><p>In a series of resolutions during plenary on Wednesday, the upper chamber urged the President to declare bandits as terrorists and treat them the same way Boko Haram insurgents are being treated.</p><p>The Red chamber called on the Federal Government to wage total war against the bandits, including bombing all their locations to annihilate and eliminate them.</p><p>According to the Senate, all known leadership of the bandits should be declared wanted and the military should arrest and prosecute them.</p><p>Following the Senate directive to Buhari, the House of Representatives on Thursady also <a href=# rel=noopener>demanded the proscription of bandits</a>.</p><p>The chairman of the House Committee on Defence, Babajimi Benson moved a motion of urgent public importance on the matter.</p><p>Moving the motion, Benson said the declaration of bandits as terrorists can be done through a proscription order, adding that it will serve as an added impetus for the brave security personnel to redouble their efforts at dealing with this menace.</p><p>He added that such declaration when given the force of law will renew the vigour and resolve of our gallant security personnel in dealing with the menace of banditry as the mode of operations and rules of engagement will be scaled up accordingly.”</p><p>The Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, asked if there was any opposition to the motion, the lawmakers chorused, “No!”</p><p>The motion was then adopted through a voice vote by the whole House.</p><h2>That will be all for this week!
