And if you can’t help them, at least don’t hurt them. ― <i>Dalai Lama</i></li><li>The best antidote I know for worry is work. The best cure for weariness is the challenge of helping someone who is even more tired. One of the great ironies of life is this: He or she who serves almost always benefits more than he or she who is served. ― <i>Gordon B. Hinckley</i></li><li>Good works is giving to the poor and the helpless, but divine works is showing them their worth to the One who matters. ― <i>Criss Jami</i></li><li>Remember this. Hold on to this. This is the only perfection there is, the perfection of helping others. This is the only thing we can do that has any lasting meaning. This is why we're here. To make each other feel safe. ― <i>Andre Agassi</i></li><li>I would rather help the weak than conquer the strong. ―<i> Matshona Dhliwayo</i></li><li>It's not enough to have lived. We should be determined to live for something. May I suggest that it be creating joy for others, sharing what we have for the betterment of person kind, bringing hope to the lost, and love to the lonely. ― <i>Leo Buscaglia</i></li><li>Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around. ― <i>Leo Buscaglia</i></li><li>There is nothing more beautiful than someone who goes out of their way to make life beautiful for others. ― <i>Mandy Hale</i></li><li>But even with the inspiration of others, it's understandable that we sometimes think the world's problems are so big that we can do little to help. On our own, we cannot end wars or wipe out injustice, but the cumulative impact of thousands of small acts of goodness can be bigger than we imagine.<i> ― Queen Elizabeth II</i></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/edc2428923612dd0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 30 relatable loneliness quotes and sayings</span></p></a><h2>What is a good quote about kindness?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/91b0e23fa6fe555a.jpg><p class=align-left>Kindness is an act of being friendly, considerate, and generous.

It is more of a statement of disbelief than a question. All we could hope for is that our collective voice against the inhumanity of the few and our universal desire to live in a compassionate filled world extinguish the fire of hatred others have spawned. Let us not forsake our humanity. ― <i>Dodinsky</i></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e7212f8b1b696e29.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Viktor Frankl quotes from Man's Search for Meaning</span></p></a><h2>Quotes about serving others</h2><p class=align-left>Do you have a favourite quote about helping others?

It takes a lot of courage and selflessness to reach out to others, especially those who are suffering.</p><p class=align-left>Helping starts from the mind and trickles down to taking action that yields results.
