Pooping at work but forgot you need detergent? No problem, just have it Amazon-Primed right to your door.</p><p>The problem is, there are throngs of people who roam around neighborhoods during the day when no one is home <a href=#>and pilfer</a> your packages. That's where video doorbells like Ring are a godsend.</p><p>I've personally been the target of several package thieves. Most of the time, it was probably just a crime of opportunity. I live right near a bus stop — so maybe, right after hopping off their commute line, someone thought it'd be a good idea to steal the Macho Man Randy Savage costume I assembled for myself on Amazon days before Halloween, leaving me in quite the jam.</p><p>It's comforting/alarming to see I'm not alone in this plight, however, thanks to the Ring Neighbors app.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">This "ninja trained" thief got caught on a Ring.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"This caper made off with a very lucrative and highly sought after dog harness. He clearly is displaying high level of training. Be on the lookout for this ninja like bandit."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Pretending to be a PECO worker.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"Please attention to this lady she pretend as a peco worker before came ask for info.now she come again and it’s in the midnight.please check all your door and window before go to bed.please be more alert.thank you"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The meter thief.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>What's really interesting about the app is coming across all of the different scams and "covers" the thieves concoct, thinking they're slick. They'll put on different disguises and act like they're official employees in an attempt to either break into your home or take your boxed goodies.</p><p>But this gentleman took it a step further and decided to straight up steal a PECO electric meter. I don't even know where he's going to sell that thing, or maybe he'll dismantle it and use it for parts?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">But if this app proves anything ...</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"Be careful of this package thief. Didn’t steel because it was dog food."</p><p>It's that folks will steal whatever they can get their hands on. Usually they're like this individual and just nab packages. At least they put it back because they didn't know how to flip a bag of dog food. Amateur.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">But Ring doorbells capture other alarming activity.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"This guy wouldn’t leave my door for 20 minutes. I do not know this man. He looked into my basement windows, door window, and living room windows. He then started throwing rocks at my bedroom window and checked to see if anybody was looking. Called the cops but by the time they got there he left."</p><p>Like this "creepy" dude who wouldn't leave someone's front door and kept throwing rocks at the home he was loitering outside of. Scary.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Here's another thief with a brilliant cover.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"She is pretending to be on the phone as she put the packages in her bag."</p><p>They pretend like they're on the phone, in plain view of construction workers nonetheless, stealing packages from the front of someone's home.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Others are guilty of more serious crimes.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Ring</a></figure><p>This guy's face that was illuminated for everyone to see. For some reason, he thought it'd be a good idea to try and burn a church to the ground. Must be taking the lyrics to whatever Black Metal song he was listening to very seriously.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Most of the crimes are as casual as this.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"Someone stole a package from our front stoop. Did a really good job covering their face."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">You'll also catch the occasional peeping tom.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Could they be scoping out the home for a potential score? Or are they just trying to catch a glimpse of you singing "Wrecking Ball" in your underwear while you gallivant through your home?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Some are repeat offenders.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"I hope this guy got caught someday. My package arrived six days earlier and usps/seller didn’t send any notice. The delivery guy didn’t ring any bell."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Others just want to take a seat.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>The short description of the video thoroughly sums up this Ring community user's disbelief that someone would actually go out of their way to filch a chair.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Others are looking for sweet premium parking.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Ring</span></figure><p>But going to the doctor and having them clear you for a handicap tag is such a hassle. Why not just steal it from someone's car?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">No one's package is safe.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"Guy clearly looking for packages. Unfortunately found the box that was delivered and placed behind the bush next to my steps. Doesn’t seem phased by or aware of the ring and took his time searching my neighbors’ areas as well. Keep a look out for this upstanding member of society."</p><p>Even if it's hiding behind a bush.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Sometimes, the doorbells catch peeps who are high out of their minds.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"This was scary, man on my porch last night pulled his pants down and rang my door bell repeatedly.He was on something."</p><p>Yeah, I'd rather not have that kind of night call while I'm chilling at home wondering what I'm doing with my life.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Another crime of opportunity.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Just going about his day on a lovely bike ride, sees a package and says, "Ohoo! Don't mind if I do!" It kind of makes you want to leave dummy packages filled with poop in your neighborhood, doesn't it?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">"Awww shucks...nothing to steal."</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"Just to let everyone know and be on alert for this Suspicious Guy in the Beanie. He came in our backyard and was looking around. He didn’t steal anything but was definitely looking for something to steal. Be careful!"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Even your laundry isn't safe.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"Not a clear shot of his face but this guy stole a bag of delivered laundry to our house. Please don’t shame me for this being on our door step for an hour before I got home, I take responsibility for this ultimately and am making adjustments on this. Just thought people knowing this guy is helping himself would be valuable information to put out there to the neighborhood."</p><p>Even if you don't have a Ring doorbell, it could be kind of cool to install the app and see what crimes people are reporting, it basically turns your phone into a community watch forum.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7avs4ycpqalpaO2tcWMqaasrKM%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fring-community-posts.html&text=These%20Ring%20Community%20Posts%20Prove%20That%20People%20Will%20Steal%20Anything&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fring-community-posts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fring-community-posts.html&title=These%20Ring%20Community%20Posts%20Prove%20That%20People%20Will%20Steal%20Anything" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fring-community-posts.html&title=These%20Ring%20Community%20Posts%20Prove%20That%20People%20Will%20Steal%20Anything" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fring-community-posts.html&title=These%20Ring%20Community%20Posts%20Prove%20That%20People%20Will%20Steal%20Anything" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fring-community-posts.html&description=These%20Ring%20Community%20Posts%20Prove%20That%20People%20Will%20Steal%20Anything" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./plateau-killings-tight-security-amidst-arrival-of-nysc-members-at-new-camp-ground.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tight Security Amidst Arrival Of NYSC Members At New Camp Ground">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./michael-malarkey-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael Malarkey - Age, Family, Bio">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
