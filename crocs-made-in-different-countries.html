Having first been released back in 2002, these hole-riddled foam-based shoes have either become are either an ironic fashion statement or the bane of sneakerheads and taste-havers everywhere with virtually no in-between. The shoes have even earned meme status on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Know Your Meme</a> for their odd design and absurdly wide appeal.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But whether you love them or hate them, Crocs are here to stay. In fact, the brand has sold nearly 300 million pairs of shoes by 2017 and even experience a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">massive surge</a> of popularity between 2020 and 2022, due partly to a shift in consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>These days, Crocs are something you'll probably find all over the world. However, it might surprise you to know that they're made all over the world too, as one group on <a href=#>TikTok</a> discovered.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A group of friends discovers that all of their Crocs are made in different countries.</h2><p>In a TikTok posted in early August 2023, TikToker Ahleesahc (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@ahleesahc</a>) made an interesting observation about her Crocs when compared to other Crocs. At the time, she was with a group of people who were all wearing Crocs at the time. You might not believe what she found.</p><p>She kicks off her short video by revealing that her Crocs were made in Mexico. Then she went down the line to the rest of the Crocs wearers. One person was wearing Crocs made in Vietnam, another pair was from China, and the fourth pair was made in Indonesia.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>You don't need Google Maps to tell you how far all of these countries are from each other, but it's certainly interesting to know that Crocs are manufactured in vastly different parts of the world.</p><p>The official Crocs website even lists many of their countries of manufacturing. These include China, Italy, Mexico, Vietnam, or Bosnia.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Interestingly enough, it doesn't list Indonesia as one of the countries, even though one pair is supposedly from there. In fact, other sites like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wearably Weird</a> confirm that some Crocs are also made in Argentina, Romania, and Herzegovina.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As if that weren't intriguing enough, OP even tested out different pairs of Crocs and found that they all felt a little different. In a follow-up TikTok, she stepped into each pair of shoes and rated her comfort level in each one.</p><p>In her personal tier list, Indonesia got a 5 out of 10 while Vietnam topped the list with a perfect 10. Mexico earned an 8 and China closes out the rankings with a 9. However, she even tried a pair of Crocs from Colorado in a third video, which she called the comfiest of all the ones she tried on.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Commenters started checking their own Crocs.</h2><p>If you're a Crocs owner who went to check your own pair to see where they're from after seeing this, you're not alone. Plenty of people in the comments of the original video checked their own Crocs to see where they were manufactured.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Some got similar results to the Crocs wearers in the comments. However, other people found that their shoes were made in places like Bosnia.</p><p>Many also deduced that their different manufacturing locations is a big reason as to why Crocs sizes always run different on different occasions.</p><p>So where are your Crocs from? Are they from a different country or is the manufacturing center around the corner from you?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmL%2Bwr9JmpJqclWK2r3nDop2fnaKau7V5wqisp6yinrK0</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcrocs-made-in-different-countries.html&text=Friends%20Discover%20Their%20Crocs%20Were%20Made%20in%20Different%20Countries&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcrocs-made-in-different-countries.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcrocs-made-in-different-countries.html&title=Friends%20Discover%20Their%20Crocs%20Were%20Made%20in%20Different%20Countries" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcrocs-made-in-different-countries.html&title=Friends%20Discover%20Their%20Crocs%20Were%20Made%20in%20Different%20Countries" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcrocs-made-in-different-countries.html&title=Friends%20Discover%20Their%20Crocs%20Were%20Made%20in%20Different%20Countries" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcrocs-made-in-different-countries.html&description=Friends%20Discover%20Their%20Crocs%20Were%20Made%20in%20Different%20Countries" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mae-questel-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mae Questel - Trivia, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./details-of-actress-ada-amehs-burial-emerges.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Details Of Actress Ada Ameh's Burial Emerges">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
