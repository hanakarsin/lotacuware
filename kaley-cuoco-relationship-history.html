People are now more curious than ever to know about the former <a href=#>Big Bang Theory</a> star's love life and relationship history.</p><p>Here’s some insight into some of the lasting and memorable romances Kaley has experienced over the years.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kaley Cuoco's public relationship history starts in 2002.</h2><p>Kaley dated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Thad Luckinbill</a> back in 2002. He's an actor in shows like The Young and the Restless and Supernatural. The cause of their breakup is still a mystery. Kaley and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Zegers</a> met on the set of their joint film The Hollow in 2003. They totally hit it off and started dating while they were still co-stars. Their relationship after a year, though.</p><p>During Kaley's 2005 to 2006 relationship with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jaron Lowenstein</a>, they appeared at multiple red carpet events together. Jaron has made a name for himself in the music industry as a country star. They dated for one year.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kaley Cuoco's relationship history continues into the mid-2000s.</h2><p>Kaley was rumored to be dating <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Al Santos</a> in 2007. Relationship details between Kaley and Al have never been confirmed, but the rumors about a potential romance made the rounds. He's an actor and former male model.</p><p>Kaley first crossed paths with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Josh Henderson</a> in 2002 when he guest-starred in an episode of Eight Simple Rules with her. They didn’t reconnect until years later in 2007, and the relationship fizzled before they hit their one-year mark.</p><p>Kaley also dated <a href=#>John Galecki</a> from 2007 to 2009. They played one of the sweetest on-screen couples ever on Big Bang Theory. For 12 seasons, they took on the roles of Leonard and Penny, and the world totally fell in love with their chemistry. They kept their relationship super low-key, quietly dating for two years before ending things in 2009. Kaley got engaged to Josh Resnick in 2011. He's an addiction specialist who popped the question to her in October of 2011.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The couple never made it down the aisle and called it quits. Kaley then dated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christopher French</a> from 2011 to 2012. Although relationship details between Kaley and Christopher haven’t been released to the public, they were linked between 2011 and 2012. It’s unclear if they dated off and on, or if they were ever an official couple. Next up is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brett Bollinger</a>, a singer from a band called Pepper.</p><p>He was first spotted kissing Kaley at a Lakers game in Los Angeles back in 2012. The PDA they shared was enough to let the world know about their seriousness, but they ended up calling it quits in 2013. Kaley then married former tennis player <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Sweeting</a> in 2013. They tied the knot on New Year’s Eve in December of 2013. Their wedding took place a mere three months after he popped the question. They ended up separating in September of 2015 and finalizing their divorce about eight months after that.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Following her divorce, Kaley dated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Blackthorne</a> from 2015 to 2016. Paul, an actor from Arrow, sparked up a relationship with her three months after she filed for divorce from Ryan in 2015. Paul and Kaley ultimately called it quits in 2016.</p><p>She moved on with <a href=#>Henry Cavill</a> in 2016. It's one of the shortest Hollywood relationships in history. She and the Superman actor started dating in July 2016 but broke up 10 days later.</p><p>After that brief fling, Kaley met <a href=#>Karl Cook</a> in 2016 at a horse show. They obviously had enough in common because he asked her to marry him during the winter of that year. They officially got married in California in June of 2018 but announced their breakup in September 2021. Kaley has reportedly remained single since then.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Kaley dating anyone now?</h2><p>Power couple alert! On May 3, 2022, Kaley took to Instagram and shared several affectionate selfies with her new beau, <a href=#>Ozark</a> actor Tom Pelphrey. Additionally, the 36-year-old's <a href=#>boyfriend</a> confirmed their relationship with his own social media post.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Tom Pelphrey (@tommypelphrey)</a></p></figure><p>The two-time Daytime Emmy winner shared two Polaroid photos of him and Kaley alongside a swoon-worthy caption.</p><p>"But nothing can save you. Not your friends, not the best Fred Astaire musical you’ve ever seen — the grace of it, not your mother’s beauty, not a line from a letter you find at the bottom of a drawer, not a magazine or the next day. Nothing can save you."</p><p>He continued, "And you stand in the moonlight, and a sweetness comes off the top of the trees, and the fence around the yard seals you off from the dark, and you can’t breathe. It is all so familiar and possible. It is too simple that there is this much good in the world, and you don’t know how to have it."</p><p>"And it makes you wonder when it was you lost your place. Then you catch a breeze, so warm and ripe, it makes you hope that someone will come who also cannot save you, but who will think you are worth saving," Tom concluded.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoK6tsdhmmq6nk6R6s7HLmquip56otaq8jKGgrKyfp8Y%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkaley-cuoco-relationship-history.html&text=Kaley%20Cuoco%27s%20Relationship%20History%20Contains%20Some%20Notable%20Men&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkaley-cuoco-relationship-history.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkaley-cuoco-relationship-history.html&title=Kaley%20Cuoco%27s%20Relationship%20History%20Contains%20Some%20Notable%20Men" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkaley-cuoco-relationship-history.html&title=Kaley%20Cuoco%27s%20Relationship%20History%20Contains%20Some%20Notable%20Men" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkaley-cuoco-relationship-history.html&title=Kaley%20Cuoco%27s%20Relationship%20History%20Contains%20Some%20Notable%20Men" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkaley-cuoco-relationship-history.html&description=Kaley%20Cuoco%27s%20Relationship%20History%20Contains%20Some%20Notable%20Men" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./402630-kevin-harts-personal-shopper-allegedly-defrauded-him-r17m-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kevin Hart's personal shopper allegedly defrauded him of over KSh 120 million">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./andy-warhol-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Andy Warhol - Trivia, Family, Bio">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
